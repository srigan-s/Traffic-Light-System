# Traffic Light System 🚦
 
This project simulates a **4-way traffic light intersection with a street lamp** using Arduino (C++). It demonstrates hardware prototyping, soldering, and embedded programming to mimic a real-world traffic system.

## 🛠️ Project Description  

The system was built on a square cardboard base, decorated with construction paper to represent pavement and roads.  

- **Traffic Lights:**  
  - Constructed from popsicle sticks, straws, LEDs, and electrical wiring.  
  - Wires were soldered to LEDs and neatly routed through straws, acting as poles.  
  - Anchored into holes in the cardboard to hide wiring underneath.  
  - Connected to a breadboard and Arduino boards mounted on top for accessibility.  
  - Programmed with a **15-second light cycle** to simulate real traffic flow.  

- **Street Lamp:**  
  - Built using a yellow LED, a BBQ skewer, and a popsicle stick.  
  - Programmed with a light sensor to automatically **turn on in darkness**.  

Together, these components create a functional and visually realistic intersection model.
